# SDL2_Lazy_Foo
This repository contains my codes on how I followed the tutorial from lazyfoo.net  
This repository does not aim to be a tutorial nor plagiarized from LazyFoo  
This repository is only for tracking my learning progress, regarding SDL2.  
  
Most C codes in the tutorial were converted to C++ eg. NULL to nullptr, printf to std::cout/cerr, ** to *& (pointer arguments as pass by reference)  
Most functions are modified to be passed by reference to remove global variables  
Huge thanks and credits to: Lazy_Foo, lazyfoo.net
