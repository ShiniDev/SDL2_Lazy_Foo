# SDL2_Lazy_Foo
This is a repository containing codes and files from lazy foo's sdl2 tutorial.
Most C codes in the tutorial were converted to C++ eg. NULL to nullptr, printf to std::cout/cerr
Most functions are modified to be passed by reference to remove global variables
Huge thanks and credits to: Lazy_Foo, lazyfoo.net
